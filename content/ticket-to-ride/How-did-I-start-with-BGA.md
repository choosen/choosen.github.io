## My dev team 

We organised in my former __SpaceOS__ company biweekly game times (1 hour) as a team icebreaker.

Our team played couple times games like:
* 2 truths and 1 lie
* Gartic Phone
* Tixid
* Saboteur
* CodeNames
* LLama
* Among Us
* Bang!

There was couple teammates enjoying especially board games,
which shifted them in the COVID time to play online on [BoardGameArena](BoardGameArena.com).
So we started to play there together during game time: LLama, Saboteur and finally Bang!

**BGA** is a quite popular platform using more than 12 servers for free/paid games online.

Currently BGA states that they are 11 461 000 players to challenge to 1 035 games.


## My curiosity around BGA

I discovered mature BGA portal, it worked well, had intructions for each game.
I checked what other games they had in portfolio.
Then I found the game TicketToRide.

I played this casual board game couple times on New Years Eve longer holidays.

Games seemed to be simple, you catch the rules in 5 minutes.
My friend beat everybody significantly.

I decided to play it online to prepare for next meeting.

## Skill advance in BGA

After couple winning games, I looked into ELO ranking (similar to chess).
It presented clear numbers, that the game is not so random as it seems to be:
There are champions, which loose rarely, almost only against top players.

I played some online tournament open for everybody (20 games, 1 every week in async mode. 5 months of playing :O),
then some Arena games for more advanced players.
After reaching higher ELO I joined some __strong__ players tournament, 
which tought me how to play on high level.

I felt the game engine, scoring well. 
I developed my blocking tactics, managing tickets and adjusting game pace in 1 vs 1 games, 
which are very competetive in comparision to 3/4/5 players game.
