Funny story about why the game attracted me so much last year :)

## My dev team 

In my former company, __SpaceOS__, we organized biweekly game sessions (1 hour) as a team icebreaker.

Our team played games like:
* 2 truths and 1 lie
* Gartic Phone
* Tixid
* Saboteur
* CodeNames
* LLama
* Among Us
* Bang!

A few teammates particularly enjoyed board games,
which led them to shift to online play on [BoardGameArena](BoardGameArena.com) (BGA) during COVID times.

So, we started playing together there during game time, mainly Llama, Saboteur, and eventually Bang!

**BGA** is a quite popular platform, using more than 12 servers for free and paid online games.

Currently, BGA states that they are 11M players competing in over 1K games.


## My curiosity around BGA

I discovered that BGA was a well-developed platform with clear instructions for each game.
I explored its game portfolio and eventually found Ticket to Ride.

I had played this casual board game a few times during New Yearâ€™s Eve and longer holiday breaks.

The game seemed simpleâ€”you grasp the rules in five minutes. But my friend consistently beat everyone.

So, I decided to play online to prepare for our next meeting.

## Skill advancement in BGA

After winning a few games, I looked into the ELO ranking system (similar to chess).

The numbers revealed that the game wasnâ€™t as random as it seemedâ€”there were champions who rarely lost,
except against other top players.

I joined an online tournament open to everyone (20 games, one per week in async modeâ€”five months of playing! ðŸ˜²).

Then, I played Arena games for more advanced players.

After reaching a higher ELO, I joined __strong__ player tournaments, which taught me how to play at a high level.

I started understanding the game engine better and scoring well.

I developed blocking tactics, ticket management strategies, and learned to adjust the game pace in 1v1 matches,
which are much more competitive compared to 3/4/5 player games.
