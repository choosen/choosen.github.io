I won a qualification knockout tournament for the Europe time zone (one of four for Europe and one of 14 worldwide) and received a special gift from the **Days Of Wonder** team! 🎉

To win, I had to secure nine consecutive victories, including a match against the current ELO ranking leader on BGA.

## 🎁 The gift

After receiving instructions from the organizer on how to claim my reward (I had to send my address and BGA nickname), I sent an email and forgot about it.

A few days later, I traveled to Sicily for some climbing and relaxation in the warm weather. 😎🏔️

Then, out of nowhere, I got an unexpected SMS about a delivery from "Executive" (?).

At first, I thought it might be a gift from my company’s Executive Leadership Team (ELT) or maybe, by accident, a server from a churning client. 😅

## 📦 Unboxing the Package

The package was quite long, so I initially thought it might be a rack server. 

But after opening it, I realized it was my Days of Wonder reward!

Inside, there was a beautifully designed card and a premium storage box with a magnetic cover. 😍

The core of the gift was exactly what I had hoped for—a special 20th Anniversary Edition train set for Ticket to Ride! 🚂

A huge thanks to Days of Wonder for celebrating the 20th anniversary of their legendary game with such an amazing tournament and rewards!

## 🏆 My Tournament Journey

I didn’t qualify for the Top 8 offline finals in Paris, but reaching the semifinals was still a huge achievement for me! 🎖️

Days of Wonder has been known for fast game distribution in the U.S. and Europe, proving that they’ve been an outstanding board game publisher from the start.

During the tournament, I met players who have been playing for almost 20 years!
Compared to their experience, I still feel like a newbie. 😆

It was a demanding (and sometimes stressful) tournament, but I enjoyed every moment of it! 🚀
