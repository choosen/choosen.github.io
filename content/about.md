Hello

I am Ruby on Rails web developer for many years. I have the only one daughter and live in Poznan, Poland.

I like to hike, climb. My plan is to reach higher peak than 4,500m and collect highest 14 polish tatras peaks with topographic prominence higher than 100m.

I used to play squash, but I resigned as was to close to compete on the too high level to be healthy.

I play a little chess, contract bridge. Lately I played *Ticket To Ride* on [BoardGameArena](BoardGameArena.com), which is quite competive when playing duels.

Ambitious, motivated and open minded.
