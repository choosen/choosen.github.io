Hello

I am Ruby on Rails web developer for many years. I have the only one daughter and live in Poznan, Poland.

I like to hike, climb. My plan is to reach higher peak than 4,500m and collect [highest 14 tatras peaks](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wielka_Korona_Tatr) with topographic prominence higher than 100m.

I used to play squash, but I resigned as was to close to compete on the too high level to be healthy.

I play a little chess, contract bridge. Lately I played *Ticket To Ride* on [BoardGameArena](https://BoardGameArena.com),
which is quite competitive when playing duels.
See posts in [Ticket-To-Ride](/ticket-to-ride) section for more.

Ambitious, motivated and open minded.
